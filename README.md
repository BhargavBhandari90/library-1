rtMedia Code Snippet Library
========================

This is a repository of code snippets that help modify the default behavior of [rtMedia](https://rtmedia.io/).

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.

## Using Snippets

Most files in this library are set up to be WordPress plugins:

1. Click on the filename of the snippet you'd like to use.
2. Click the "Raw" button (next to "Blame" and "History") at the top right.


And then copy and paste the code into your child theme's functions.php or place inside a custom functionality plugin.

## Submitting Your Snippet

We welcome and encourage everyone to submit their code snippets. If you would like to submit your snippet, please [fork](https://github.com/rtMediaWP/library/fork) the repository and then create a [pull request](https://github.com/rtMediaWP/library/compare/).

Please refer to the [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/rtMediaWP/library/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting your pull request.

## Proposing a Snippet

If there is a snippet you are unable to find and would like to propose get written, please open an [issue](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/issues) and describe your need.

## Notes

These snippets come with no guarantees. Due to the constant evolution of the rtMedia codebase, it is possible that the behavior of these snippets may change overtime. Find something broken? [Let us know](https://github.com/rtMediaWP/library/issues)!
